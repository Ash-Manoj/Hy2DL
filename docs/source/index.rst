Welcome to the Hy2DL's documentation
====================================

This is the documentation for the Hy2DL Python package.
The source code is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/eduardoAcunaEspinoza/Hy2DL>`_.

On this documentation page, you'll find a :doc:`guide <usage/models>` of the different models implemented in the library. 
We have also included a :doc:`guide <usage/config>` with the different arguments that can be used to configure the experiments. 
Finally, the :doc:`API docs <api/hy2dl>` show all modules, classes, and functions available.
